# A personal website built using TailwindCSS

So this is [my personal website](https://whomwah.com). It's very simple. It's built standalone using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and is managed using [vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/).

It's also uses SASS. It didn't need to but I wanted to know how to integrate it as it's something I would use on a more complex website.

There are a few simple commands:

```
yarn run dev - this will run a dev server at http://localhost:3000 which updates on changes
yarn run build - this will build a production version in a dist/ directory in the root
yarn run preview - this will serve the production build at http://localhost:5000
```
